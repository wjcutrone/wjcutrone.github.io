		My name is Will Cutrone. I live in Ewing NJ, but I am originally from Connecticut. I am a data science student enrolled in a coding bootcamp at Rutgers University. I went to college at Quinnipiac University and have a degree in health sciences. I am looking to combine my knowledge from my undergraduate years and the skills from this bootcamp in order to ideally land a job working with healthcare data.
